## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Jacob**, or **codist** as I'm known online. I am a English **programmer** located in **Canada**. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I like to create random projects or games just for the fun of it, even if they *aren't particularly useful.*\
If you would like to chat with me about anything, I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ImCodist) where we can do so.
